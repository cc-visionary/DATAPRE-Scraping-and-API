A love team is a partnership. If you\u2019re in a love team, you pull each other up. It\u2019s really team work. <em>Feeling ko</em> (I feel that) I\u2019m already past that. When you reached this age, <em>feeling ko wala ng</em> (I feel that there shouldn\u2019t be a) love team,\u201d she added.</p><p>Nadine rose to fame with her reel-to-real partner, actor and singer James Reid, after being paired for the first time in <em>Diary ng Panget</em> back in 2014. After multiple films and series together, the highly followed JaDine love team decided to go their <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/249803-james-reid-nadine-lustre-breakup/\">separate ways </a>in January 2020.</p><p>Aside from wanting to go solo with her career, Lustre also expressed interest in doing films or projects outside the romance genre.</p><p>\u201c<em>Alam na ng mga tao kung paano ako sa</em> (People already know how I am with) love stories,\u201d she expressed. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for me to do other genres.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<em>Gusto ko psychopath naman ako in my next project. Something different. Para naman exciting siya kung gagawin ko. Para iba din ang pakiramdam kung iba\u2019t ibang characters ang gagawin mo,</em>\u201c<em> </em>she added. (I want to be a psychopath in my next project. Something different. It excites me. Also because it\u2019s interesting if you play different characters.)</p><p>\u201c<em>Ang na-miss ko talaga sa pag-arte, where you portray a character. I don\u2019t mind doing thriller, action, horror. Scripts that are mind-boggling. Kapag binasa mo, talagang mapapa-isip ka</em>,\u201d she added. (What I really miss about acting is when you portray a character. I don\u2019t mind doing thriller, action, horror. Scripts that are mind-boggling, that when you read them will really make you think).</p><p>When <em>Greed </em>was pitched to the actress, she felt excited about doing something different. </p><p>\u201cWhen Boss Vic (del Rosario of Viva) and Direk Yam pitched this <em>Greed</em> project to me, <em>sobrang na-excite ako. Ang saya ko din. </em>(I got really excited. And I was happy.)<em> </em>Finally, the project is no longer romantic comedy or drama. Horror-thriller ang <em>Greed</em>, so very exciting din for me (<em>Greed </em>is a horror-thriller, so it\u2019s also very exciting for me),\u201d Nadine said.</p><p>Before the project, Nadine had been focusing on her music under James\u2019 record label, Careless Music, and released an all-original, 12-track album, <em>Wildest Dreams, </em>in October 2020, in time for her 28th birthday. She also <a href=\"https://news.abs-cbn.com/life/12/10/21/nadine-lustre-admits-having-own-place-in-siargao\">stayed in Siargao</a> for a while amid the pandemic.</p><p><em>Greed </em>is scheduled to premiere on March 16 on Vivamax Plus, and on April 8 on Vivamax. The movie follows the story of a couple who wins the biggest lottery jackpot and attempts to make a quiet exit from their sleepy town, except things don\u2019t go as planned.</p><div class=\"rappler-ad-container\"><div class=\"rappler-ad rappler-ad--middle-2 rappler-ad--desktop\" id=\"gpt-middle-2\" style=\"min-width: 1px; min-height: 1px;\"></div><script>   window.rapplerAds.displayAd( \"middle-2\" );  </script></div><div class=\"rappler-ad-container\"><div class=\"rappler-ad rappler-ad--mobile-middle-2 rappler-ad--mobile\" id=\"gpt-mobile-middle-2\" style=\"min-width: 1px; min-height: 1px;\"></div><script>   window.rapplerAds.displayAd( \"mobile-middle-2\" );  </script></div><p>Nadine also hinted at more projects coming her way.</p><p>\u201c<em>Definitely, I can finally say na tuloy-tuloy na \u2018to</em>,\u201d she said. \u201c<em>Of course, gusto ko na talagang bumalik sa acting scene.</em>\u201d (I can definitely say that this is just the start. Of course, I really want to return to the acting scene).</p><p>\u201cThis is really something that I enjoyed doing. I\u2019m really happy because this time around, everyone is really trying to make an effort into changing the genres and the stories that are being given to me.\u201d</p><p>Nadine went through a <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/celebrities/viva-artists-agency-files-lawsuit-nadine-lustre/\">legal battle </a>with Viva Artist Agency after announcing she would be <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/250321-nadine-lustre-leaves-viva-artist-agency/\">terminating her contract</a> in January 2020.

That should elicit a more revealing answer, as does a school test question that calls for an explanatory essay for an answer, not a mere choice from a supplied set of choices or, even less usefully, a choice between yes and no. But I do understand that a television debate with multiple debaters has to be tightly time-bound.</p><p>All candidates, in any case, agreed that the money should be returned, except one \u2013 Isko Moreno Domagoso. It was he, in fact, who had inspired the question. He had come to the debate with a forced hand, having declared in an earlier news interview pocketing the P50 million left unspent from the donations for his mayoral run in 2019.\u00a0</p><p>One candidate, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., escaped being asked \u2013 he was absent; he in fact <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/nation/elections/presidential-bets-roast-ferdinand-bongbong-marcos-jr-cnn-philippines-debate/\">avoids these debates</a>. Indeed, what does he care? The question may not even be relevant in his case: with the huge fortune his family amassed, by plunder, during his father\u2019s dictatorial presidency, he should be able, easily, to spend for his own campaign. And, coming from a family of self-entitled and well-practiced appropriators, he cannot be expected to return anything.\u00a0</p><p>Actually, unspent donations may be kept as personal earnings, provided that the corresponding income tax is <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/nation/elections/isko-moreno-performance-cnn-ph-presidential-debate-2022/\">paid</a> which, in \u00a0<a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/nation/elections/isko-moreno-performance-cnn-ph-presidential-debate-2022/\">Domagoso\u2019s case</a>, came to P9 million. Conceivably, to some extent, it is a practice among candidates. As a rule, however, those who do practice it understandably prefer to keep the matter between them and the taxman, or, in any case, as private as possible; after all, although perfectly legal, it is not exactly the nice thing to do.</p><p>But then, apparently, Domagoso saw some political advantage in publicizing his case. He promoted himself as honest taxpayer, as if he were a shining exception, at the same time having an allusive but unmistakable and not altogether undeserved dig at a strong rival \u2013 Marcos.</p><p>Despite repeated internal revenue demands, <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/plus-membership-program/exclusive-content/backstory-ferdinand-bongbong-marcos-jr-taxes-lies/\">Marcos himself has refused to pay taxes</a>, amounting to hundreds of millions of pesos. The case actually raises an incidental but more basic question: Does any of the money on which the taxes have been assessed form part of the Marcos plunder, estimated at $10 billion in total, and now claimed by Ferdinand Jr. as legitimate inheritance?</p><p>Anyhow, here lies what seems to me a superficial cleverness in Domagoso\u2019s tactic: he has chosen to compare himself with a decidedly disreputable character to distract from his own flaws, his own opportunism in this particular instance. So, keep your eye on the ball, and the ball is not the P9 million Domagoso put in the treasury, but the P50 million he put in his pocket. Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is a mere distraction, Isko Moreno Domagoso is the issue.</p><p>I\u2019ve heard the excuse that it\u2019s difficult to determine how to prorate the reimbursements because expenses from donations are not always tracked to their specific donors. But why bother at all with the donors? Doubtless fully aware of the nature of the deals they have got themselves into, none of them should expect to be reimbursed. Paid back by their victorious bets with favors, yes, but reimbursed?</p><p>An alternative, of course, is to give the money to charity. That, of all candidates, Domagoso missed such an obvious, noble choice makes him a fraudulent champion of the poor. Oh, how he likes proclaiming common cause with them by virtue of common experience! But that\u2019s in the long past; he is definitely poor no more, not by virtue of common cause, not by virtue of common experience, not by virtue of net worth \u2013 not by virtue period.</p><p>He has done too well at raising himself from poverty to comfort, and done so with apparently little regard for scruples, to be credible as the champion he advertises himself to be. And, whether he wins the election or not, he\u2019s likely to fare better yet, likely, by the formula of political proportions, to swell his net worth by a greater measure after running for president than after running for mayor.</p><p>And if he wins in May as president he will be made dizzy by further, richer, and endless prospects for appropriation. \u2013 <strong>Rappler.com</strong></p><div class=\"post-single__taboola\"><div id=\"taboola-below-article-thumbnails\"></div><script type=\"text/javascript\"> window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'alternating-thumbnails-b', container: 'taboola-below-article-thumbnails', placement: 'Below Article Thumbnails', target_type: 'mix' }); </script></div></div><div class=\"post-single__moodmeter\"><div id=\"moodmeter\"></div></div></div>"}, {"Title": "Meet Matthew Go, the first Filipino diplomate of the American Board of Forensic Anthropology", "URL": "https://www.rappler.com/nation/overseas-filipinos/matthew-go-american-board-forensic-anthropology-first-filipino-diplomate/", "Category": "Filipino Scientists", "Date Published": "Mar 12, 2022 12:00 PM PHT", "Author": "Angel Ty", "Full Article": "<div class=\"article-main-section\"><div class=\"post-single__image\"><div class=\"entry-thumbnail\"><img alt=\"Meet Matthew Go, the first Filipino diplomate of the American Board of Forensic Anthropology\" class=\"wp-image-1614820 wp-post-image\" height=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" src=\"https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2022/03/matthew-go-March-12-2022.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2022/03/matthew-go-March-12-2022.jpg?resize=1280%2C720&amp;zoom=1 1280w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2022/03/matthew-go-March-12-2022.jpg?resize=1280%2C720&amp;zoom=0.5 640w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2022/03/matthew-go-March-12-2022.jpg?resize=1280%2C720&amp;zoom=0.25 320w\" width=\"1280\"> <div class=\"overlay overlay--closed\"><p class=\"overlay__caption overlay__caption\">      EXAMINING.

The ABFA is one of only four certification bodies for forensic anthropologists in the world. In its 45-year history, at least 153 people gained diplomate status at the ABFA.</p><p>Rappler got a chance to sit down with Go after achieving the milestone in his career. Here is his story.</p><h5>Discovering forensic anthropology</h5><p>Go was born and raised in the Philippines, but dreamed of studying abroad. He sent applications to big universities in the country such as the University of the Philippines and the Ateneo de Manila University, but he also tried his luck at universities abroad.\u00a0</p><p>The stars aligned for him when he got accepted at the Simon Fraser University in Canada. Like many Filipino students, Go followed the wishes of his parents when it came to his college degree. His parents wanted him to pursue medicine, so he took up behavioral neuroscience.</p><p>After one semester, Go realized he was not fully satisfied with his degree program. He was still interested in human biology, but longed for something more.</p><p>\u201cHow can I apply biology to something more in the humanitarian sector or sphere \u2013 something to do with human rights? That was more exciting to me<em>,\u201d</em> Go said, explaining how he explored forensic anthropology.</p><p>Go learned that forensic anthropology expanded the study of human remains into the context of their deaths. If a passerby were to discover human remains, he said, an anthropologist can determine things beyond their height and sex.</p><div class=\"rappler-ad-container\"><div class=\"rappler-ad rappler-ad--middle-2 rappler-ad--desktop\" id=\"gpt-middle-2\" style=\"min-width: 1px; min-height: 1px;\"></div><script>   window.rapplerAds.displayAd( \"middle-2\" );  </script></div><div class=\"rappler-ad-container\"><div class=\"rappler-ad rappler-ad--mobile-middle-2 rappler-ad--mobile\" id=\"gpt-mobile-middle-2\" style=\"min-width: 1px; min-height: 1px;\"></div><script>   window.rapplerAds.displayAd( \"mobile-middle-2\" );  </script></div><p>\u201cWe can analyze gunshot wounds, stab wounds, blunt force trauma, things like that\u2026. And that information can help with whatever investigation needs to be done, like who\u2019s this person; what happened to them? We figure out who that person is; we pursue a case. Does a criminal investigation need to be opened?\u201d Go said.</p><p>Forensic anthropologists also help in investigations of mass disasters, airplane crashes, or terrorist bombings \u2013 crucial in determining identities of multiple victims that can get mixed up. \u201cAn anthropologist can go and sort the remains out into their discrete individuals,\u201d he said.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1614809\" height=\"1024\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" src=\"https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2017-01-26-at-5.33.16-PM.png?fit=810%2C1024\" srcset=\"https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2017-01-26-at-5.33.16-PM.png?fit=690%2C1024&amp;zoom=1 690w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2017-01-26-at-5.33.16-PM.png?fit=690%2C1024&amp;zoom=0.5 345w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2017-01-26-at-5.33.16-PM.png?fit=690%2C1024&amp;zoom=0.25 173w\" width=\"690\"><figcaption>AT WORK. Matthew Go evaluates remains that were disinterred at a cemetery in Manila. Photo by Paul Michael Atienza</figcaption></img></figure><h5>Going through the eye of the needle</h5><p>Being awarded the ABFA diplomate status means having exemplary expertise in forensic anthropology, which is why applying for it was no easy feat for Go. To apply, he had to submit case reports, scholarly publications, relevant work experiences, and letters of recommendation \u2013 a process that took him more than three months to complete.\u00a0</p><p>For the examination, Go was given a reading list of over 400 references, ranging from two-page articles to an entire textbook. \u201cIt was so insurmountable that when I saw it, it was insane<em>,</em>\u201d Go told Rappler.</p><p>Aside from the tedious application process, Go also had to face battles of his own. Since he was no longer affiliated with a university, he had difficulty accessing online journals that were part of the reading list. Since it was blocked by a paywall, he had to ask his friends from the university to access journals for him. \u201cI had to do that a hundred times,\u201d shared Go.</p><p>Finances also became an issue given that the application process was not cheap. He had to pay for examination fees as well as flights to and from the testing center, accommodation and other miscellaneous expenses, all coming from his own pocket.</p><p>It took Go 10 months to finish the application process. Upon receiving a results email, he said he was hesitant to open it, anticipating a failed result. \u201cI was too scared to open it. I forwarded it to a friend. <em>Nag-Facetime kami, and sabi ko open the letter for me</em> (We were on Facetime, and I told them to open the letter for me),\u201d Go said.\u00a0</p><p>Contrary to what he expected, his hard work paid off.</p><p>\u201c<em>I feel very validated, na parang Matt 12 years ago was hoping this would come and finally tapos na</em> (the Matt 12 years ago was hoping this would come and finally it did)<em>,</em>\u201d he shared.\u00a0</p><p>Paul Gideon Lasco, a Filipino anthropology expert and published author, shared with Rappler that he is extremely proud of Go\u2019s accomplishment. \u201cI hope this certification will empower Matthew to further contribute in promoting forensic anthropology as an important subfield of anthropology in the country,\u201d Lasco said.</p><div class=\"rappler-ad-container\"><div class=\"rappler-ad rappler-ad--middle-3 rappler-ad--desktop\" id=\"gpt-middle-3\" style=\"min-width: 1px; min-height: 1px;\"></div><script>   window.rapplerAds.displayAd( \"middle-3\" );  </script></div><div class=\"rappler-ad-container\"><div class=\"rappler-ad rappler-ad--mobile-middle-3 rappler-ad--mobile\" id=\"gpt-mobile-middle-3\" style=\"min-width: 1px; min-height: 1px;\"></div><script>   window.rapplerAds.displayAd( \"mobile-middle-3\" );  </script></div><h5>Longing for home</h5><p>Go  has constantly longed for Filipino culture after staying abroad for almost nine years for school and work. From the food to seeing his family and friends, it is the reason why Go makes it a point to go home every year, \u201c<em>kahit bumagyo pa</em> (even if there\u2019s a storm)<em>,</em>\u201d he added.\u00a0</p><p>He also misses the <em>kaladkarin </em>culture in the Philippines, where he simply asks his friends to go out with him at a moment\u2019s notice. \u201cThat\u2019s not really a thing here in the States because everyone\u2019s so busy. In the Philippines, <em>magte-text lang na \u2018Uy labas tayo, kain tayo\u2019</em> (they\u2019ll just text, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s go out and eat\u2019). I love that kind of camaraderie that I can\u2019t find in the US,\u201d Go said.</p><p>For Filipinos aspiring to make a mark in the international science community, Go shared a piece of wisdom that he lives by, \u201cDon\u2019t lose sight of your goals and set them high.\u201d He said that there are so many opportunities abroad for bright Filipino minds, so they should never stop dreaming of achieving great things.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1614814\" height=\"682\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2022/03/37377505_1740492099321591_5066643563266179072_n-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C1024\" srcset=\"https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2022/03/37377505_1740492099321591_5066643563266179072_n-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;zoom=2 2048w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2022/03/37377505_1740492099321591_5066643563266179072_n-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;zoom=1.5 1536w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2022/03/37377505_1740492099321591_5066643563266179072_n-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;zoom=1 1024w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2022/03/37377505_1740492099321591_5066643563266179072_n-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;zoom=0.5 512w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2022/03/37377505_1740492099321591_5066643563266179072_n-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;zoom=0.25 256w\" width=\"1024\"><figcaption>TEACHING.

As a student, my hopes and dreams were to bring it back to the Philippines,\u201d he said.</p><p>When asked if this would be anytime soon, he said that the current conditions in the Philippines are not very suitable given that the science industry is not very supported here.\u00a0</p><p>In May 2017, then-senator Paulo Benigno \u201cBam\u201d Aquino IV said that the Philippines <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/nation/169716-philippines-lack-scientists-bam-aquino/\">lacked 19,000 scientists</a> to be a significant force in research and development. President Rodrigo Duterte signed into law the <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/nation/205434-duterte-signs-balik-scientist-law-philippines/\">Balik Scientist Act in June 2018</a>, providing incentives and assistance to returning Filipino experts, scientists, inventors, and engineers.</p><p>Still, some experts find that the Philippines <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/voices/ispeak/opinion-need-scientific-revolution-philippines/\">lags behind in supporting its scientists</a>. The Department of Science and Technology suffered an almost P76-million cut from its ambitious P36.269-billion proposed budget for 2021. Then, in 2022, the DOST\u2019s budget <a href=\"https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1164866#:~:text=MANILA%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Department%20of%20Science,a%20taped%20report%20aired%20online.\">was reduced by P919.8 million</a> compared to its budget in 2021.</p><p>\u201cBut if the conditions were right, I would definitely go back home and contribute and give back,\u201d said Go.<strong> \u2013 Rappler.com</strong></p><p><em>Angel Ty is a Rappler intern.

We\u2019re already live with Atome in several other markets and building on this regional partnership, we are delighted to now make this service available to travellers in the Philippines.

Iran denied having a role.</p><p>The UAE felt equally frustrated in January when Yemen\u2019s Houthis launched attacks on Abu Dhabi. Despite UAE calls for Biden to reinstate a terrorist designation for the Iranian-backed group, Washington has yet to do so.</p><h5>Phone call snub</h5><p>The Gulf source and another source familiar with the matter told Reuters that Biden had irked UAE de facto ruler Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, known as MbZ, by not calling swiftly after the Houthis struck.</p><p>\u201cBiden called him three weeks after. MbZ didn\u2019t take the call. Your ally comes under a terrorist attack and you wait three weeks to call?\u201d the Gulf source said.</p><p>White House National Security Council spokesperson Emily Horne said on Wednesday there had been \u201cno issues with having a call\u201d and Biden would speak with the UAE leader soon. A UAE foreign ministry spokesperson said a call was being scheduled.</p><p>Last month, Biden spoke with Saudi\u2019s King Salman while the crown prince, known as MbS, was in the room. Sources said Biden had asked to speak with the crown prince but MbS declined because the call had only been scheduled with the king.</p><p>The White House and Saudi government did not immediately respond to a Reuters requests for comment on the episode. The White House told a briefing on Monday, March 7, there were no plans \u201cat this point\u201d for Biden to call MbS.</p><p>The Ukraine crisis has erupted as the United States, Russia, and other world powers have been in talks to revive the nuclear pact with Iran.

In the Philippines, the word \u201cendemic\u201d has become quite the buzz word in recent weeks. Many have associated the word endemic as the \u201cend\u201d of COVID-19 in society, which implies that our lives are bound to be easier in the years to come.\u00a0 </p><p>Endemicity, however, is not as straightforward as mainstream media and some quoted experts would have us believe. There\u2019s more to the word \u201cendemic\u201d than meets the eye, and this has implications on how we will move forward with COVID-19.\u00a0</p><p>Epidemiologists would broadly classify a disease as either in a state of <em>epidemic</em>, <em>pandemic</em>, and <em>endemic</em>. These terms describe the occurrence rate of a disease geographically. An epidemic occurs when there is rapid spread and occurrence of a disease over a particular area. A pandemic occurs when this rapid spread occurs on a global scale. If complete eradication of a disease is not possible, then a disease moves into a state of being endemic. </p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States defines endemic as\u00a0 <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson1/section11.html\">\u201cthe constant presence and/or usual prevalence of a disease or infectious agent in a population within a geographic area.\u201d</a> Note the words, \u201cconstant presence\u201d and \u201cwithin a geographic area.\u201d An endemic disease is also described as predictable in terms of rate and spread. Some experts would surmise that, given these definitions, <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1547334/why-covid-19-will-never-become-endemic\">COVID-19 remains to be in a pandemic state</a>, as it is\u00a0not simply located in a geographical area but all around the world. It has yet to reach a steady state of predictability.\u00a0</p><h5>Levels of endemicity</h5><p>Epidemiologists believe we <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2781945?resultClick=1\">can no longer eradicate COVID-19 completely</a>. Having COVID-19 vaccinations and/or infection <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2787944\">does not guarantee life-long immunity.</a> Even the creation of vaccine \u201cbubbles\u201d or a population comprising of\u00a0fully-vaccinated individuals does not guarantee against breakthrough infections or reinfections. The spread of the Omicron variant ensured that in the beginning of 2022. As such, it is likely that COVID-19 will always be present in the general population.\u00a0</p><p>Once the disease becomes endemic, we can hope to lower the number of new cases of COVID-19 to the barest minimum. This is called <em><a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2781945?resultClick=1\">elimination </a> \u2013 </em>a difficult but not impossible goal if we do the necessary public health work to achieve it. In this ideal endemic scenario, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su48a7.htm\">SARS-CoV-2 may continue to exist in the physical environment,</a> but will struggle to\u00a0cause relevant debilitating diseases to the general population, as exhibited by near-zero symptomatic infections and even severe disease.\u00a0 </p><p>In a less than ideal scenario, an endemic COVID-19 entails that we will have to live with the virus through a state of <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2781945?resultClick=1\"><em>cohabitation</em></a>. Many of us are hopeful that we can at the very least achieve this level of endemicity and begin the process of economic recovery. Cohabitation would be described as having \u201csparse reinfections, rare vaccine breakthroughs, and a negligible secondary transmission in the face of the most viral variants.\u201d </p><p>However, another potential endemic scenario is <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2781945?resultClick=1\"><em>conflagration</em></a><em> </em>in which SARS-CoV-2 moderately infects and kills members of the population and which can eventually birth other variants with the potential to cause new outbreaks. This scenario wouldn\u2019t be so rosey and is a possibility that we need to account for when we consider COVID-19 as endemic. Clearly, as it is, endemic does not mean harmless.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1614641\" height=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" src=\"https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2022/03/COVID-19-Graph-March-12-2022-001.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2022/03/COVID-19-Graph-March-12-2022-001.jpg?resize=1280%2C720&amp;zoom=1 1280w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2022/03/COVID-19-Graph-March-12-2022-001.jpg?resize=1280%2C720&amp;zoom=0.5 640w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2022/03/COVID-19-Graph-March-12-2022-001.jpg?resize=1280%2C720&amp;zoom=0.25 320w\" width=\"1280\"/></figure><h5>A brief history of endemic diseases</h5><p>In the history of the world, there has not been a pandemic quite like COVID-19. Sure, we have likened COVID-19 to the 1918 spanish flu pandemic, but comparing the two has its limits.\u00a0For one, we didn\u2019t even know viruses existed back then, and the modern vaccination methods we know today had not yet been invented. The 1918 flu virus eventually became endemic around the world, birthing several different pandemics in succeeding decades. This virus turned into the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-commemoration/milestone-infographic.htm\">seasonal flu we now know today.</a> </p><div class=\"rappler-ad-container\"><div class=\"rappler-ad rappler-ad--middle-2 rappler-ad--desktop\" id=\"gpt-middle-2\" style=\"min-width: 1px; min-height: 1px;\"></div><script>   window.rapplerAds.displayAd( \"middle-2\" );  </script></div><div class=\"rappler-ad-container\"><div class=\"rappler-ad rappler-ad--mobile-middle-2 rappler-ad--mobile\" id=\"gpt-mobile-middle-2\" style=\"min-width: 1px; min-height: 1px;\"></div><script>   window.rapplerAds.displayAd( \"mobile-middle-2\" );  </script></div><p>As such, it is not surprising why we think COVID-19 will go the same way as the flu. It should be noted, however, that COVID-19 has currently <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2021/09/20/covid-19-set-to-overtake-1918-spanish-flu-as-deadliest-disease-in-american-history/\">out-classed the 1918 pandemic</a> in terms of cases and deaths.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Endemicity looks different for various diseases. Other infectious diseases, such as malaria, tend to remain present in areas around the world. Malaria continues to kill in the Philippines; 90% of cases are in Palawan. Tuberculosis infection is also known to be endemic throughout the Philippines. Some would even argue we still have a TB epidemic, but we have considered daily infection rates and deaths as \u201cacceptable\u201d parts of Philippine society.\u00a0</p><h5>So is COVID-19 endemic?\u00a0</h5><p>Other scientists have suggested to qualify a disease as endemic by examining three aspects of the disease, namely,  the rates of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and immunity. According to Dr. John Wong, an epidemiologist from EpiMetrics, the following should be satisfied:\u00a0\u00a0</p><ol><li>The levels of cases are low and can be sustained at such a low level.\u00a0</li><li>The number of deaths are acceptable by society.</li><li>Excellent levels of immunity should be achieved through vaccinations or disease recovery.\u00a0</li></ol><p>Who determines that the criteria above have been met requires deliberation, and that government must play a strong role in that process. Take for example deaths. When do we say that the death rate is acceptable in society? Some countries would look at pre-pandemic influenza (flu virus) death rates as a <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2787946\">benchmark.</a> In the Philippines, influenza has been estimated to contribute on average around <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7299398/\">5,347 deaths per year</a>. By comparison,\u00a0COVID-19 killed over 50,000 in just two years.</p><h5>How the world regards an endemic COVID-19\u00a0</h5><p>\u00a0As of writing, the Philipipines has yet to set clear specific goals in declaring an endemic COVID-19 while different nations around the world have begun approaching COVID-19 as endemic. A major consideration has been to restart economic activity. Levels of vaccinations and falling death rates have also been taken into consideration as a basis for their approach.\u00a0 </p><p><a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/thailand-adopts-guidelines-declaring-covid-19-endemic-82528353\">Thailand, for example</a>, has already set a criteria for themselves, and it involves having less than 10,000 cases per day, 0.1% case fatality rate for those admitted, and an 80% fully-immunized vaccination rate for those at high risk.\u00a0 Some European nations have even considered <a href=\"https://www.firstpost.com/world/explained-what-it-means-for-covid-19-to-be-endemic-and-how-europe-is-considering-new-strategy-10304691.html\">surveillance for seasonal flu</a> among its people as a proxy of COVID-19 infection. Looking towards an endemic COVID-19, these countries have begun the work for that transition.\u00a0</p><div class=\"related-article\"><div class=\"related-article__container\"><div class=\"related-article__text\"><div class=\"related-article__eyebrow\">      Must Read     </div><div class=\"related-article__title\"><a class=\"related-article__title-link\" href=\"https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/explainers/strategies-end-pandemic-vaccinate-elderly-mask-up/\"><h1 class=\"related-article__title-text\"> Ending the pandemic: Vaccinating the elderly, masking up, and other strategies </h1></a></div></div><div class=\"related-article__media-container\"><div class=\"related-article__media\"><a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/explainers/strategies-end-pandemic-vaccinate-elderly-mask-up/\"><img alt=\"Ending the pandemic: Vaccinating the elderly, masking up, and other strategies\" class=\"wp-image-1179811 wp-post-image\" height=\"253\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px\" src=\"https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2021/07/janssen-johnson-johnson-covid-19-coronavirus-vaccination-vaccine-july-30-2021-001.jpg?fit=449%2C449\" srcset=\"https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2021/07/janssen-johnson-johnson-covid-19-coronavirus-vaccination-vaccine-july-30-2021-001.jpg?fit=449%2C253&amp;zoom=2 898w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2021/07/janssen-johnson-johnson-covid-19-coronavirus-vaccination-vaccine-july-30-2021-001.jpg?fit=449%2C253&amp;zoom=1.5 674w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2021/07/janssen-johnson-johnson-covid-19-coronavirus-vaccination-vaccine-july-30-2021-001.jpg?fit=449%2C253&amp;zoom=1 449w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2021/07/janssen-johnson-johnson-covid-19-coronavirus-vaccination-vaccine-july-30-2021-001.jpg?fit=449%2C253&amp;zoom=0.5 225w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2021/07/janssen-johnson-johnson-covid-19-coronavirus-vaccination-vaccine-july-30-2021-001.jpg?fit=449%2C253&amp;zoom=0.25 112w\" width=\"449\"></img></a></div></div></div></div><h5>Not necessarily harmless</h5><p>An endemic COVID-19 by itself is not necessarily a reprieve and it does not mean \u201charmless.\u201d SARS-CoV-2 variants have been known to emerge <a href=\"https://healthcare.utah.edu/healthfeed/postings/2021/01/covid19-variants.php\">independently from one another</a>.

That was the highest inflation rate since 2008, but still only a fraction of the levels other industrialized countries face.</p><p>A combination of factors lies behind Switzerland\u2019s modest price pressures: consumers demanding better deals, an energy mix that leaves the country less exposed than others to soaring oil and gas costs, wage restraint, and some protection against import price inflation from the strong franc.</p><p>Certainly, part of the reason for low Swiss inflation is because the cost of living here is already so high.</p><p>\u201cOne of the aspects of Switzerland is that we tend to have high prices in practically everything when you compare it with our neighbors in Europe,\u201d said Nannette Hechler-Fayd\u2019herbe, global head of economics and research at Credit Suisse.</p><p>Savvy Swiss consumers have found some workarounds.</p><p>An hour\u2019s drive from Zurich, just across the border into Germany, a cottage industry of \u201cdelivery address\u201d firms has sprung up, charging Swiss customers a small fee to hold goods they order at bargain German prices and later collect.</p><p>\u201cPeople come here because they can buy at favorable prices,\u201d said entrepreneur Mandy Klein, a German who started her delivery address business from home in 2009 and now runs two depots in the picturesque lakeside German border town of Constance.</p><p>The brisk delivery trade in Constance shows Swiss households\u2019 drive to reduce their living costs wherever possible. Even so, <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Comparative_price_levels_of_consumer_goods_and_services\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Eurostat figures</a>\u00a0show\u00a0the price level for household consumption expenditure was still 60% higher in Switzerland in 2020 than the euro area average.</p><p>The upshot is that consumer groups, fed up of Switzerland being a \u201chigh-price island,\u201d have lobbied for political action which resulted in two legislative changes from the beginning of this year to give households a better deal.</p><p>The first toughened up Switzerland\u2019s cartel law to impede businesses from marking up their prices for the Swiss market.</p><p>The second measure banned so-called geo-blocking, used by retailers to prevent online shoppers from buying cheaper products or services from sites abroad by, for example, diverting them to Swiss websites.</p><div class=\"rappler-ad-container\"><div class=\"rappler-ad rappler-ad--middle-2 rappler-ad--desktop\" id=\"gpt-middle-2\" style=\"min-width: 1px; min-height: 1px;\"></div><script>   window.rapplerAds.displayAd( \"middle-2\" );  </script></div><div class=\"rappler-ad-container\"><div class=\"rappler-ad rappler-ad--mobile-middle-2 rappler-ad--mobile\" id=\"gpt-mobile-middle-2\" style=\"min-width: 1px; min-height: 1px;\"></div><script>   window.rapplerAds.displayAd( \"mobile-middle-2\" );  </script></div><p>Prisca Birrer-Heimo, a lawmaker of the center-left Social Democrats who co-led a \u201cfair price initiative\u201d demanding reform, has seen an impact already.</p><p>\u201cThere is still potential, but we have noticed the enormous price differences are no longer as big as they were,\u201d she told Reuters.</p><h5>Money spinner</h5><p>Characteristics specific to Swiss markets, and the weight of certain key items in the consumer price index (CPI), also help explain why inflation is so low in Switzerland.</p><p>Health care, for example, which is provided by private firms, accounts for 17% of the CPI index,\u00a0compared to 7% in the United States and 5% in Germany, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) data show. The government has\u00a0prodded\u00a0health insurance companies to trim premia.</p><p>\u201cThis has been an area, which instead of creating inflation and price increases, has rather seen the contrary out of political pressure,\u201d said Hechler-Fayd\u2019herbe at Credit Suisse.</p><p>Thanks to Switzerland\u2019s lakes, rivers, and mountainous geology,\u00a0hydropower\u00a0accounts for around 57% of the country\u2019s energy production, the federal energy office says, leaving the Swiss far less exposed than others to spiraling oil and gas prices.</p><p>The resulting efficiencies mean energy makes up just 5% of the Swiss CPI basket,\u00a0OECD data show, compared to 7% in the <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/business/united-states-ban-russia-oil-energy-imports-march-2022/\">United States</a> and 10% in <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/business/germany-dependence-russia-gas-supply/\">Germany</a>, where consumers are far more exposed to rising fossil fuel prices.</p><p>\u201cOur best guess is that [average] inflation in 2022 in Switzerland is running at 1.8%, although the recent surge in oil prices raise the risk of a somewhat higher rate,\u201d said Hechler-Fayd\u2019herbe at Credit Suisse. \u201cFor 2023, we think inflation will average 1%.\u201d</p><p>With\u00a0wages\u00a0already higher than in nearly all other European countries, there is less pressure for raises. Telecoms operator Swisscom\u00a0is increasing salaries by just 0.9% this year.</p><p>The\u00a0strong franc\u00a0also helps. Seen as a safe haven, the franc this month briefly rose above parity with the euro and hit a seven-year high.</p><p>The currency\u2019s purchasing power gives Switzerland some protection against higher import costs and feeds into the stable domestic price environment, giving exporters an opportunity to gain an edge over foreign rivals facing higher inflation.</p><p>Jean-Philippe Kohl, vice director and head of economic policy at electrical and mechanical engineering industry group Swissmem, said half of the sector\u2019s exports go to the eurozone, where <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/business/inflation-rate-eurozone-february-2022/\">inflation</a> is running close to 6%.</p><p>\u201cSooner or later, a Swiss company that manufactures a product here and sells it in the eurozone will be able to sell it at a higher price\u2026so you profit from it,\u201d he said. <strong>\u2013 Rappler.com</strong></p><div class=\"post-single__taboola\"><div id=\"taboola-below-article-thumbnails\"></div><script type=\"text/javascript\"> window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'alternating-thumbnails-b', container: 'taboola-below-article-thumbnails', placement: 'Below Article Thumbnails', target_type: 'mix' }); </script></div></div><div class=\"post-single__moodmeter\"><div id=\"moodmeter\"></div></div></div>"}, {"Title": "Ukrainians at Dubai Expo face future in limbo as war rages at home", "URL": "https://www.rappler.com/business/ukrainians-dubai-expo-2020-face-future-limbo-war-rages-home/", "Category": "Russia-Ukraine Crisis", "Date Published": "Mar 11, 2022 8:45 PM PHT", "Author": "Reuters", "Full Article": "<div class=\"article-main-section\"><div class=\"post-single__image\"><div class=\"entry-thumbnail\"><img alt=\"Ukrainians at Dubai Expo face future in limbo as war rages at home\" class=\"wp-image-1614391 wp-post-image\" height=\"835\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1350px) 100vw, 1350px\" src=\"https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2022/03/dubai-expo-ukraine-march-9-2022-reuters-001-b.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2022/03/dubai-expo-ukraine-march-9-2022-reuters-001-b.jpg?resize=1350%2C835&amp;zoom=1 1350w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2022/03/dubai-expo-ukraine-march-9-2022-reuters-001-b.jpg?resize=1350%2C835&amp;zoom=0.5 675w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2022/03/dubai-expo-ukraine-march-9-2022-reuters-001-b.jpg?resize=1350%2C835&amp;zoom=0.25 338w\" width=\"1350\"> <div class=\"overlay overlay--closed\"><p class=\"overlay__caption overlay__caption\">      EXPO.

He looked uncomfortable amid the attention, but finally cracked a smile.</p><p>His grin was about more than just the record, as the Spurs rallied from 15 points down in the fourth quarter to give Popovich the win. San Antonio had been 0-33 in games it was trailing entering the final period.</p><p>The victory, Popovich\u2019s 1,336th, pushed him past Don Nelson. Popovich is his 26th\u00a0NBA\u00a0season, all with the Spurs. He tied Nelson on March 7 via a victory over the Los Angeles Lakers, but San Antonio lost its last game.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s obvious what happened, but it\u2019s just a testament to a whole lot of people,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cSomething like this does not belong to one individual \u2013 you know basketball is a team sport, and you know you appreciate your players that they have to do it together.

Rudy Gay hit a three-pointer with two seconds left, but Murray added another free throw, and the Jazz could not get off another shot.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just one win tonight,\u201d Popovich added. \u201cThe record is there, but the win feels better actually than the record tonight, because Utah has a hell of a team.

Over time, the dinners grew more collegial.</p><p>Both sides shared\u00a0an interest in stabilizing prices after the 2014-2016 price war. Prices crashed even more sharply when demand collapsed during the pandemic in 2020. Global exploration spending\u00a0sank\u00a0last year to about $51 billion, according to Morgan Stanley estimates, the same as 2005, even though oil consumption last year was 24% higher.</p><p>Falling oil and gas investment and investors shifting capital to renewable fuels means the spare oil capacity available to the world in an emergency is roughly 2% of total demand, Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said this week.</p><p>The last time oil topped $120 per barrel as it did earlier this month, a global recession followed six months later. Each 10% increase in oil price will cost consumers $23 billion, estimates JPMorgan.</p><p>\u201cNobody really anticipated needing to grow significantly\u201d this year, said Occidental Petroleum CEO Vicki Hollub this week. Companies that had not budgeted for production increases, she said, cannot now turn on a dime and pump more.</p><p>Shortages of critical equipment and supplies also are working against output gains. Labor shortages have also boosted costs.</p><p>\u201cYou would wait several months for a new rig, the service provider would have to go find new employees to man that rig.

If the farmers can\u2019t feed those crops soon, far fewer of the so-called tillers will spout, jeopardizing a <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/business/russia-ukraine-conflict-highlights-wheat-supply-vulnerability/\">national wheat harvest</a> on which millions in the developing world depend.</p><p>The wheat was planted last autumn, which, after a brief growing period, fell dormant for the winter. Before the grain returns to life, however, farmers typically spread fertilizer that encourages the tillers to grow off the main stalks. Each stalk can have three or four tillers, increasing the yield per wheat stalk exponentially.</p><p>But Ukrainian farmers \u2013 who produced a record grain crop last year \u2013 say they now are short of fertilizer, as well as pesticides and herbicides. And even if they had enough of those materials, they can\u2019t get enough fuel to power their equipment, they add.</p><p>Elena Neroba, a Kyiv-based business development manager at grain brokerage Maxigrain, said Ukraine\u2019s winter wheat yields could fall by 15% compared to recent years if fertilizers aren\u2019t applied now. Some farmers warn the situation could be much worse.</p><p>Some Ukrainian farmers told Reuters their wheat yields could be cut in half, and perhaps by more, which has implications far beyond Ukraine. Countries such as <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/business/ukraine-crisis-jeopardizes-middle-east-black-sea-wheat-supply/\">Lebanon, Egypt, Yemen, and others</a> have come to rely on Ukrainian wheat in recent years. The war has already caused <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/business/updates-global-grains-prices-march-7-2022/\">wheat prices</a> to skyrocket \u2013 rising by 50% in the last month.</p><p>The Ukrainian farming crisis comes as food prices around the world already have been spiking for months amid global supply chain problems attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/business/united-nations-fao-food-price-index-february-2022/\">World food prices</a> hit a record high in February, and have risen over 24% in a year, the United Nations food agency said last week. Agriculture ministers from the world\u2019s seven largest advanced economies\u00a0were due\u00a0Friday, March 11, to discuss in a virtual meeting the impact of Russia\u2019s invasion on global food security and how best to stabilize food markets.</p><p>International food and feed prices could rise by up to 20% as a result of the conflict in Ukraine, triggering a jump in global malnourishment, the UN food agency said on Friday.</p><p>Ukraine and Russia are <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/business/ukraine-shuts-down-ports-conflict-threatens-grain-supplies-february-24-2022/\">major wheat exporters</a>, together accounting for about a third of world exports \u2013 almost all of which passes through the Black Sea.</p><p>Svein Tore Holsether, president of Norway-based Yara International, the world\u2019s largest maker of nitrogen-based fertilizers, said he is worried that tens of millions of people will suffer food shortages because of the farming crisis in Ukraine. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s not whether we are moving into a global food crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s how large the crisis will be.\u201d</p><p>Ukrainian officials say they are still hopeful the country will have a relatively successful year. Much of that hope rests with farmers in the west of the country, which, so far, remains distant from the shooting.</p><p>But officials are taking measures to protect domestic supplies to ensure Ukraine\u2019s population gets fed \u2013 posing another possible hit to export shipments. Agriculture Minister Roman Leshchenko said on Tuesday, March 8, the country was banning the <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/business/ukraine-introduces-export-licenses-key-agricultural-commodities/\">export of various staples</a>, including wheat. Leshchenko has acknowledged the threat to Ukraine\u2019s food supply and that the government was doing what it can to help farmers.</p><p>\u201cWe understand that food for the entire state depends on what will be in the fields,\u201d he said in televised remarks Monday, March 7.</p><div class=\"rappler-ad-container\"><div class=\"rappler-ad rappler-ad--middle-2 rappler-ad--desktop\" id=\"gpt-middle-2\" style=\"min-width: 1px; min-height: 1px;\"></div><script>   window.rapplerAds.displayAd( \"middle-2\" );  </script></div><div class=\"rappler-ad-container\"><div class=\"rappler-ad rappler-ad--mobile-middle-2 rappler-ad--mobile\" id=\"gpt-mobile-middle-2\" style=\"min-width: 1px; min-height: 1px;\"></div><script>   window.rapplerAds.displayAd( \"mobile-middle-2\" );  </script></div><p>Moscow says it is conducting a special military operation in Ukraine to demilitarize and capture dangerous nationalists. It has denied deliberately targeting civilians and civil infrastructure, despite documented attacks on hospitals, apartment buildings, and railroads.</p><p>Grain exports are a cornerstone of Ukraine\u2019s economy.</p><p>In the coming weeks, farmers should also start planting other crops, such as corn and sunflowers, but they are struggling to get the seeds they need, said Dykun Andriy, chairman of the Ukrainian Agricultural Council, which represents about 1,000 farmers cultivating 5 million hectares.</p><p>Andriy warned that the fuel is the critical problem now. Unless farmers can get diesel to run their equipment, spring farmwork will be impossible and this year\u2019s harvests doomed. \u201cFarmers are desperate,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a big risk that we don\u2019t have enough food to feed our people.\u201d</p><p>Maxigrain\u2019s Neroba said farmers are facing fuel shortages because military needs take priority.</p><p>Ukrainian farmer Oleksandr Chumak said little work is happening in his fields, some 200 kilometers north of the Black Sea port of Odessa. He farms 3,000 hectares (about 7,500 acres) where he grows wheat, corn, sunflowers, and rapeseed. Even if he had enough fuel to get his equipment into the fields, he said he had insufficient fertilizer for all of his crops and no herbicides.</p><p>\u201cUsually we have maybe six to seven tons [of wheat] per hectare. This year, I think that if we get three tons per hectare, it will be very good,\u201d Chumak said. He added he remains hopeful that Ukrainian farmers will find a way to grow enough food to feed their countrymen, but he does not expect much will be exported.</p><p>In northern Ukraine, he said friends of his have been reduced to skimming fuel from a ditch that was filled with diesel after a Russian attack on a train spilled fuel from several tankers. Other friends, in the occupied areas near Kherson, are scavenging diesel from ambushed and abandoned Russian tanker convoys, Chumak said.</p><p>Currently, he spends much of his time preparing for a Russian assault. \u201cI live in Odessa. Every day I see rockets fly over my house.\u201d</p><p>Val Sigaev, a grain broker at RJ O\u2019Brien in Kyiv, who evacuated last week, said it is unclear how much of the usual spring farming \u2013 planting and fertilizing \u2013 would be possible. High prices for natural gas \u2013 a major input for fertilizer \u2013 sent fertilizer prices up, so some farmers postponed purchases.</p><p>\u201cSome people think we could plant as much as half of the crop,\u201d Sigaev said. \u201cOthers say that only the West will see plantings and what is produced will be strictly for Ukrainian needs.\u201d</p><p>The situation is especially dire in the southern port city of Kherson, the first Ukrainian city Russia captured after invading the country on February 24. Spring-like weather adds to farmers\u2019 urgency \u2013 if they don\u2019t tend to their fields now, this year\u2019s harvest will be a bust.</p><div class=\"rappler-ad-container\"><div class=\"rappler-ad rappler-ad--middle-3 rappler-ad--desktop\" id=\"gpt-middle-3\" style=\"min-width: 1px; min-height: 1px;\"></div><script>   window.rapplerAds.displayAd( \"middle-3\" );  </script></div><div class=\"rappler-ad-container\"><div class=\"rappler-ad rappler-ad--mobile-middle-3 rappler-ad--mobile\" id=\"gpt-mobile-middle-3\" style=\"min-width: 1px; min-height: 1px;\"></div><script>   window.rapplerAds.displayAd( \"mobile-middle-3\" );  </script></div><p>Andrii Pastushenko is the general manager of a 1,500-hectare farm just west of the city, near the mouth of the Dnipro River. Last autumn, they sowed about 1,000 hectares of wheat, barley, and rapeseed. His farm workers need to get into those fields now, but can\u2019t, he says, and they\u2019ve lost access to fuel. \u201cWe\u2019re completely cut off from the civilized world and the rest of Ukraine.\u201d</p><p>Additionally, many of Pastushenko\u2019s 80 workers cannot come to work at the farm because they live a few miles to the north, across the front line. The manager\u2019s problems are compounded because the region is drier than other agricultural areas of the country and his fields need to be irrigated. And that too requires fuel.</p><p>Unlike many, Pastushenko has a 50-metric-ton nitrogen-based fertilizer stockpile. With the fighting all around him, however, he\u2019s not sure that\u2019s such a good thing: Fertilizer is highly explosive. \u201cIf something drops from a helicopter, it could blow the whole place,\u201d he said.</p><p>He said he fears the harvest will be poor. Last year, his wheat and barley fields yielded about five metric tons per hectare.

In peacetime, much of Ukrainian agricultural exports find their way onto ships at the port, Ukraine\u2019s busiest. Today, <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/business/shipping-industry-urges-safe-passage-trapped-ships-crews-ukraine-march-10-2022/\">no ships are leaving</a> and the city is besieged by Russian forces.</p><p>Much of Ukraine\u2019s harvest was due to be exported to North Africa, the Middle East, and the Levant. According to the United Nations\u2019 World Food Programme, Ukraine supplies Lebanon with more than half of its imported wheat, Tunisia imports 42%, and Yemen nearly a quarter. Ukraine has grown to become WFP\u2019s largest supplier of food.</p><p>For some countries, rising prices <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/business/food-crisis-grows-spiraling-prices-spark-export-bans-march-9-2022/\">could hammer governments as well as consumers</a> because of state food subsidies.</p><p>Egypt, which has become increasingly dependent on Ukrainian and Russian wheat over the past decade, heavily subsidizes <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/business/russia-ukraine-invasion-threatens-make-bread-luxury-middle-east/\">bread for its population</a>. As the price of wheat rises, so will pressure on the government to raise bread prices, said Sikandra Kurdi, a Dubai-based research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute.</p><p>The country\u2019s food subsidy program currently costs the government about $5.5 billion annually. Currently, nearly two-thirds of the population can buy five loaves of round bread daily for 50 cents a month.</p><p>Other\u00a0developing countries\u00a0with similar subsidies will also struggle with rising wheat prices. In 2019, protests over bread price increases in Sudan contributed to the overthrow of the head of state, Omar al-Bashir.</p><p>For countries that provide large subsidies, rising food prices will mean that either governments take on more debt or <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/business/bread-consumers-swallow-cost-russia-ukraine-invasion/\">consumers will pay higher prices</a>, Kurdi said. <strong>\u2013 Rappler.com</strong></p><div class=\"post-single__taboola\"><div id=\"taboola-below-article-thumbnails\"></div><script type=\"text/javascript\"> window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'alternating-thumbnails-b', container: 'taboola-below-article-thumbnails', placement: 'Below Article Thumbnails', target_type: 'mix' }); </script></div></div><div class=\"post-single__moodmeter\"><div id=\"moodmeter\"></div></div></div>"}, {"Title": "Australia nears living with COVID like flu \u2013 PM Morrison", "URL": "https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-nears-living-with-covid-like-flu-scott-morrison/", "Category": "Covid-19", "Date Published": "Mar 12, 2022 1:28 PM PHT", "Author": "Reuters", "Full Article": "<div class=\"article-main-section\"><div class=\"post-single__image\"><div class=\"entry-thumbnail\"><img alt=\"Australia nears living with COVID like flu \u2013 PM Morrison\" class=\"wp-image-1588589 wp-post-image\" height=\"667\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" src=\"https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2022/02/australia-reopens-international-borders-february-21-2022-reuters.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2022/02/australia-reopens-international-borders-february-21-2022-reuters.jpg?resize=1000%2C667&amp;zoom=1 1000w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2022/02/australia-reopens-international-borders-february-21-2022-reuters.jpg?resize=1000%2C667&amp;zoom=0.5 500w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2022/02/australia-reopens-international-borders-february-21-2022-reuters.jpg?resize=1000%2C667&amp;zoom=0.25 250w\" width=\"1000\"> <div class=\"overlay overlay--closed\"><p class=\"overlay__caption overlay__caption\">      REOPENED BORDERS.
